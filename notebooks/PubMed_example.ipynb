    "RESULTS: Classification of PubMed RCT abstracts shows that performance is generally strong for METHODS and RESULTS sentences, with F1-scores around 0.87–0.88 across datasets, while BACKGROUND and OBJECTIVE sentences are more challenging. Replacing numbers with a placeholder (@) in the 20k dataset has does not have significant impact, indicating that the model relies primarily on linguistic context rather than numeric content. Expanding to the 200k dataset improves the accuracy from 80% to 82%. It slightly enhances classification of less frequent labels like OBJECTIVE, demonstrating that larger datasets help the model generalize better. Overall, the results show that dataset size is important for capturing diverse sentence structures, while some categories remain more difficult to classify regardless of the dataset quantity or replacing the numeric values with an at sign.\n",

    "Results seen here are demonstrated in the original paper: \"PubMed 200k RCT: a dataset for sequential sentence classification in medical abstracts\" where METHODS and RESULTS sentences were consistently the easiest to classify, while BACKGROUND and OBJECTIVE were more challenging as seen above. Also this method shows a normalization of numeric data which is not elaborated on in the text, but can be seen from re-running and retrieving results from all the datasets.\n"
